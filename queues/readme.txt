Programming Assignment 2: Deques and Randomized Queues


/* *****************************************************************************
 *  Explain briefly how you implemented the randomized queue and deque.
 *  Which data structure did you choose (array, linked list, etc.)
 *  and why?
 **************************************************************************** */

    Linked list for Deque because it was more efficient and easier to add items
    either from the back or front of the queue due to the linked nature of this data structure.
    Then I used a resizable array for randomized queue because the resizability
    factor accounts for the randomness factor of the queue, it was more efficient to resize the array
    only when it was needed.
